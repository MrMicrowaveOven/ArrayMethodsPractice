# ### Factors
#
# Write a method `factors(num)` that returns an array containing all the
# factors of a given number.

def factors(num)
  i = 1
  all_factors = []
  until (i > num)
    all_factors << i if num % i == 0
    i += 1
  end
  all_factors
end

# ### Bubble Sort
#
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bubble_sort
#
# Implement Bubble sort in a method, `Array#bubble_sort!`. Your method should
# modify the array so that it is in sorted order.
#
# > Bubble sort, sometimes incorrectly referred to as sinking sort, is a
# > simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through
# > the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and
# > swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the
# > list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the
# > list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller
# > elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Because it only uses
# > comparisons to operate on elements, it is a comparison
# > sort. Although the algorithm is simple, most other algorithms are
# > more efficient for sorting large lists.
#
# Hint: Ruby has parallel assignment for easily swapping values:
# http://rubyquicktips.com/post/384502538/easily-swap-two-variables-values
#
# After writing `bubble_sort!`, write a `bubble_sort` that does the same
# but doesn't modify the original. Do this in two lines using `dup`.
#
# Finally, modify your `Array#bubble_sort!` method so that, instead of
# using `>` and `<` to compare elements, it takes a block to perform the
# comparison:
#
# ```ruby
# [1, 3, 5].bubble_sort! { |num1, num2| num1 <=> num2 } #sort ascending
# [1, 3, 5].bubble_sort! { |num1, num2| num2 <=> num1 } #sort descending
# ```
#
# #### `#<=>` (the **spaceship** method) compares objects. `x.<=>(y)` returns
# `-1` if `x` is less than `y`. If `x` and `y` are equal, it returns `0`. If
# greater, `1`. For future reference, you can define `<=>` on your own classes.

class Array
  def bubble_sort!(&prc)
    prc ||= Proc.new {|a,b| a <=> b}
    swapped_this_round = true

      swapped_this_round = false
      (self.length - 1).times do |index|

          self[index], self[index + 1] = self[index + 1], self[index]

# ### Substrings and Subwords
#
# Write a method, `substrings`, that will take a `String` and return an
# array containing each of its substrings. Don't repeat substrings.
# Example output: `substrings("cat") => ["c", "ca", "cat", "a", "at",
# "t"]`.
#
# Your `substrings` method returns many strings that are not true English
# words. Let's write a new method, `subwords`, which will call
# `substrings`, filtering it to return only valid words. To do this,
# `subwords` will accept both a string and a dictionary (an array of
# words).

def substrings(string)
  output = []
  (1..string.length).to_a.each do |substring_length|
    (string.length - substring_length + 1).times do |left_letter|
      output << string.slice(left_letter, substring_length)
    end
  end
  output.uniq
end

def subwords(word, dictionary)
  substrs = substrings(word)
  dictionary.select {|dic_word| substrs.include?(dic_word)}
end

# ### Doubler
# Write a `doubler` method that takes an array of integers and returns an
# array with the original elements multiplied by two.

def doubler(array)
  array.map {|el| el * 2}
end

# ### My Each
# Extend the Array class to include a method named `my_each` that takes a
# block, calls the block on every element of the array, and then returns
# the original array. Do not use Enumerable's `each` method. I want to be
# able to write:
#
# ```ruby
# # calls my_each twice on the array, printing all the numbers twice.
# return_value = [1, 2, 3].my_each do |num|
#   puts num
# end.my_each do |num|
#   puts num
# end
# # => 1
#      2
#      3
#      1
#      2
#      3
#
# p return_value # => [1, 2, 3]
# ```


# ### Concatenate
# Create a method that takes in an `Array` of `String`s and uses `inject`
# to return the concatenation of the strings.
#
# ```ruby
# concatenate(["Yay ", "for ", "strings!"])
# # => "Yay for strings!"
# ```

def concatenate(strings)
  strings.inject {|a,b| a + b}
end
