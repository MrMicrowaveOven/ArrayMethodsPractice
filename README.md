# ArrayMethodsPractice

This is just me practicing writing my own array methods in Ruby.  I've always believed that the best way to understand methods is to write them yourself.

In respect to my new philosophy, this was done using TDD.  That is, first I wrote the specs, then I wrote the methods to pass them.
